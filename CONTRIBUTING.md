## Contributing

CiviHR is an open-source project and we welcome new contributions from the community.

## Label Types
We use the following label types for issues and pull requests:

- Bug: Fixes an error on an existing feature.
- Enhancement: Improves an existing feature without changing how it behaves (examples: performance improvement, code refactoring, adding new tests).
- New Feature: Adds a new feature to the system. It can be a completely new feature (like a new extension) or an addition to an existing feature.
